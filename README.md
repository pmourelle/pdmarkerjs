pdmarker.js
===========

pdMarker.js is intended to extend Google Maps API to play with markers.

This file was originally developed by Peter Jones for using with GMaps v2. Later had a few corrections(?) by myself (Pedro Mourelle) to make it a bit more v3 friendly.

As I don't trust too much in my code here (a couple of years have passed), please read the code before using it. 

Create issues or fork it as you need.
